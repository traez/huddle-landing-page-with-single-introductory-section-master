## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) Getting more familiar implementing multiple backgrounds  
2) How to pay attention/build for specified width  
3) Enabling responsive using aspect-ratio and sub-container width  
4) Used gap property to manipulate spacing in Flexbox  
5) Using grid-template-areas to eliminate the mathematics of grid-areas  

### Continued development

1) Forgot to implement "hover states". My apologies.  
2) Having done 11 CSS-HTML projects, I feel comfortable manipulating CSS usefully.  
Truly I was barely scratching the surface previously.  
Now time to move on to Javascript review and projects.  

### Useful resources
